# easy6502
Easy6502 by Nick Morgan is one-stop accessible tutorial on 6502 assembly language programming,
including a series of worked example programs which you can edit and run in the embedded emulator.

See http://skilldrick.github.io/easy6502/ for the live site.

This (original) fork is now in a strict maintenance-only mode. Pull requests are welcome for bug fixes.

Please see other active forks for further refinements and developments of the tutorial and the emulator:
